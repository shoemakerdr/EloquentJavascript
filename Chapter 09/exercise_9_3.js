// Chapter 9: Regular Expressions

/*
Exercise 3: Numbers again

A series of digits can be matched by the simple regular expression /\d+/.

Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must support
an optional minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal dot, and
exponent notation—5e-3 or 1E10— again with an optional sign in front of the
exponent. Also note that it is not necessary for there to be digits in front of
or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, .5 and 5. are
valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn’t.
