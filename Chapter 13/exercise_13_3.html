Exercise 3: The Catâ€™s Hat

Extend the cat animation defined earlier so that both the cat and his hat (<img
src="img/hat.png">) orbit at opposite sides of the ellipse.

Or make the hat circle around the cat. Or alter the animation in some other
interesting way.

To make positioning multiple objects easier, it is probably a good idea to
switch to absolute positioning. This means that top and left are counted
relative to the top left of the document. To avoid using negative coordinates,
you can simply add a fixed number of pixels to the position values.
