Exercise 2: Predators

Any serious ecosystem has a food chain longer than a single link. Write another
critter that survives by eating the herbivore critter. Youâ€™ll notice that
stability is even harder to achieve now that there are cycles at multiple
levels. Try to find a strategy to make the ecosystem run smoothly for at least a
little while.

One thing that will help is to make the world bigger. This way, local population
booms or busts are less likely to wipe out a species entirely, and there is
space for the relatively large prey population needed to sustain a small
predator population.
